# Discord Webhook Sender (Webhooker)

This simple web application allows you to send messages to a Discord channel using a webhook.

## Features

- **Webhook Message Sending:** `Easily send messages to a Discord channel using a webhook URL.`
- **Dark/Light Mode:** `Toggle between dark and light modes.`
- **User-Friendly Interface:** `Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.`

I plan to add embed messages in the future.
